OmniOSce v11 r151054 is out!

On the 5th of May 2025, the OmniOSce Association has released a new stable
version of OmniOS - The Open Source Enterprise Server OS. The release comes
with many tool updates, brand-new features and additional hardware support. For
details see the [release notes](https://omnios.org/rn/r54).

**Note that r151050 is now end-of-life.** You should upgrade to r151052
or r151054 to stay on a supported track. r151054 is a long-term-supported (LTS)
release with support until May 2028.

For anyone who tracks LTS releases, the previous LTS - r151046 - now enters its
last year. You should plan to upgrade to r151054 during the next twelve months
for continued support.

OmniOS is fully Open Source and free. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time and
money to keep maintaining a full-blown operating system distribution. Our
statistics show that there are almost 2'000 active installations of OmniOS
while fewer than 20 people send regular contributions. If your organisation
uses OmniOS based servers, please consider becoming a regular
[patron](https://omnios.org/patron) or taking out a
[support contract](https://omnios.org/invoice).
