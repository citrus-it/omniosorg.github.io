OmniOSce v11 r151052 is out!

On the 4th of November 2024, the OmniOSce Association has released a new stable
version of OmniOS - The Open Source Enterprise Server OS. The release comes
with many tool updates, brand-new features and additional hardware support. For
details see the [release notes](https://omnios.org/rn/r52).

**Note that r151048 is now end-of-life.** You should upgrade to r151050
or r151052 to stay on a supported track.

OmniOS is fully Open Source and free. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time and
money to keep maintaining a full-blown operating system distribution. Our
statistics show that there are almost 2'000 active installations of OmniOS
while fewer than 20 people send regular contributions. If your organisation
uses OmniOS based servers, please consider becoming a regular
[patron](https://omnios.org/patron) or taking out a
[support contract](https://omnios.org/invoice).
